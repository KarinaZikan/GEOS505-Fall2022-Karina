## My Research

I am working to develop a methodology to calculate snow depth estimates from NASA's ICESat-2 satilite in alpine watersheds. ICESat-2 carries ATLAS, a photon counting satilite lidar sensor, and reterns 6 altimitry tracks.

## Goals

1. Recreate my MatLab ICESat-2 residual comparison code in a Jupyter Notebook
2. Confidently resolve a merge conflict
3. Create a development branch, develop a feature, and then merge the branch back into main 

## SMART Goals
