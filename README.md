## My Research

I am working to develop a methodology to calculate snow depth estimates from NASA's ICESat-2 satilite in alpine watersheds. ICESat-2 carries ATLAS, a photon counting satilite lidar sensor, and reterns 6 altimitry tracks. I compare snow-on ICESat-2 tracks to snow-off elevation maps to calculate snow depth along the ICESat-2 track. 

I am transitioning to using Python from MatLab. I use use python to clip tracks to my study areas and download data using cloud computing resourses. I also wanted to trasition to python to use the sliderule python library to control track parameters when filtering ICESat-2 data and calculating elevation tracks. I also use github as version contol as I work on projects with multiple people. I would like to do more of my analysis and snow depth calculations in python as well, my ultimate goal is to publish a repository with codes anyone could use to calculate these depths anywhere there is a high resolution snow-free elevation map.

## Goals for the Semester

1. Recreate my MatLab ICESat-2 residual comparison code in a Jupyter Notebook
2. Create notebook to download ICESat-2 data from nsidc programaticaly 
3. Confidently resolve a merge conflict
